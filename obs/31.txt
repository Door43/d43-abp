Then Jesus told the disciples to get into a boat and sail to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowd. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he went up on a mountain to pray. Jesus was there all alone, and he prayed long into the evening.

Legan ampaolien nan Apo Jesus ye tatao, pinalogan na hilay mānombong na ha bangka ket pinaona na hilan lomipay ha nagdagat-dagat. Ket ha nakaalih hilaynay tatao, hiyay Apo Jesus, hinomaka yayna met ha mapantay ta makigwang ya, ket bobokod nan nadegleman ihtew. (Matt 14:22-23)

Meanwhile, the disciples’ boat was a long way from land. They were in danger, because a storm had come up and the boat was being tossed around by the waves and the wind.

Haanin, hilay mānombong na, ha anti hilayna ha bonak nin nagdagat-dagat, ampihahanggiyap ye bangka la, ta angkadopag lay makhaw a angin boy mangak-haw a dadawoyon.  (Matt 14:24)

Jesus decided to go to them, so he walked on top of the water across the lake toward the boat!

Ket ha palbangon ana, hiyay Apo Jesus linakew na hilay manombong na. Kinomodang ya ha babe lanom.  (Matt 14:25)

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, “Do not be afraid. It is I!”

Ha nakit la a main angkomodang ha babe lanom, kinalimwan la yan tobat. Ket nangha hila, a wanla, “Anito! Anito!” Noba tampol nan hinabin Apo Jesus kanla a, “Adi kawo angkalimo, ta hiko yati!” (Matt 14:26-27)

Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” Jesus told Peter, “Come!”

Haanin, nakibat yay Pedro, a wana, “Apo! No peteg a hika yain, hagyaten moko man awod a makew ihen kammo a komodang ha babe lanom!” Nakibat yay Apo Jesus kanan Pedro, a wana, “Awo, makew ka ihti.” (Matt 14:28-29a)

So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus and began to look at the strong wind and waves.

Linomombah yay Pedro ha bangka ket kinomodang yan peteg ha babe lanom a makew kana. (Matt 14:29b)

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink. He cried out, “Lord, save me!” Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”

Noba ha naedepan nan Pedro ye mangak-haw a angin, nalimwan ya, ket anlomdeg yayna. Ket impangha nay, “Apo! Apo! Iligtah moko!” 
Ket hiyay Apo Jesus, tampol na yan hinagmit ket hinabi na kana a, “Koynan kakapeyan ye pamteg mo! Taket ta ampaglowa-lowa ka?”  (Matt 14:30-31)

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, “Truly, you are the Son of God.”

Haanin, linomampat hila ha bangka. Ket ha panlomampat la, tinomggen anay mak-haw a angin. Hilay mānombong na a anti ha bangka, ha nakit laynan tinomgen ye mak-haw a dawoyon boy angin, ket inggalang laya, a wanla, “Apo, hikan peteg ye Anak nin Dioh!”  (Matt 14:32-33)
