For almost 2,000 years, the Good News of Jesus the Messiah has been spreading, and the Church has been growing. Jesus said he would return at the end of the world, but he still has not come back.


Ha mag-2,000 taon, paholong a ampitayak ye Manged a Balita tongkol kanan Apo Jesus a Māngiligtah. Ket hilay pangkat lan māmteg, paholong hilan anlomabong boy an-omaando ye pamteg la. Hinabi nan Apo Jesus a mag-odong ya lano ha kalampohan nin babe lota. Noba angga haanin, ahe ya po nag-odong.

As we wait for Jesus’ return, Christians are to live holy and godly lives. When Jesus was on earth he also said, “This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the people groups, and then the end will come.”


Ket legan ang-agaden tawoy pag-odong nan Apo Jesus, katapolan tawon magbi-ay a matoynong ha pamilew nan Apo Dioh. Ta hatew, ha anti ya po ihti ha babe lota ye Apo Jesus, hinabi nayna, a wana, “Maiadal ya po mona ha kaganaan a lalahi ihti ha babe lota ye Manged a Balita tongkol ha panakop nan Apo Dioh bayo lomateng ye kalampohan.” (Mateo 24:14)

Many people groups still have not heard about Jesus. Before he returned to heaven, Jesus gave Christians the job of bringing the Good News to those who have never heard. He said, “Go and make disciples of all people groups! The fields are ripe for harvest!”


Malabong hila po ye ahe nakange nin tongkol kanan Apo Jesus. Bayo ya nanik ha langit, intobol boy binilinan na hilay mānombong na a wana, “Lakwen yo hilay tatao ha kaganaan a lologal, ta diyagen yo hilan mānombong ko. (Mateo 28:19a) Malabong hilay tataon ampangagad nin Manged a Balita a ba-mon paday a malyadiynan popolen.” (Mateo 9:37)

Jesus also said, “A servant is not greater than his master. You will be tortured and killed because of me. In this world you will have trouble, but be encouraged. I have defeated Satan! Remain faithful to the end, and you will be saved.”


Hinabi na po Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hiyay ipoh, aliwa yan matagay kanan amo na. Paidapan la kawo boy pateyen oli kangko. Malabong a kaidapan ye madihaan yo ihti ha babe lota, noba adi kawo angkahindak. Ta hinambot ko yaynay Satanas! Pakatana kawon mapatayaan anggan kalampohan, ket maligtah kawo.”

Jesus told his disciples a story which helped explain what the end would be like. “The Kingdom of God is like a man who planted good seed in his field. But while he was sleeping, his enemy came and planted weeds along with the wheat, and then he went away.”


Intongtong nan Apo Jesus kanlan mānombong na, ye wanae omon na ipalinaw kanla no way-omen ye kalampohan nin kaganaan. Hinabi na, “Hiyay panakop nan Apo Dioh, mailalayi ya ha dinyag nin maghay tao a nanabwag nin manged a bini ha pananamanan na. Noba ha madeglem legan angkatoloy hilay tatao, linomateng yay kaaway na ket hinabwagan na met nin lahi' nin ilamon ye pananamanan na haka na linakwanan.  (Mat 13:24-25)

“When the plants sprouted, the workers asked their master, ‘Sir, you planted good seed in that field. Why are there weeds in it?’ The master answered, ‘An enemy has planted them.’”


Ha nanawa yayna, ket nakit ana met ye iilamon. Kaya-bay nakew hilay iipoh kanan amo la. Ket magha kanla ye nanepet, a wana, ‘Apo, aliwa nayi a manged ye inhabwag mon bini'? Taket ta main yayna met iilamon ha nanamanan mo? Way-ihtew ibat ye iilamon?’ ” 
“Nakibat yay amo kana a, ‘Ah! Dapat nan kaawayko yati.’ ”  (Mat 13:26-28a)

“They responded, ‘Should we pull out the weeds?’ The master said, ‘If you do that, you will pull out some of the wheat as well. Wait until the harvest and then gather the weeds into piles to be burned, but bring the wheat into my barn.’”


“Ket haanin, nanepet hilay iipoh kana, a wanla, ‘Labay mo nayi, Apo, a oloten mi hilaynay ilamon?’ ” 
‘ “Adey, ta no oloten yo hila, maka maidaman yon maolot ye intanem ko. Paolayan yo hilaynan nakahale angga ha pamopol. Ta kananyatew a panaon, habiyen ko kanan mamopol, a, ‘Oloten yo po mona ye ilamon boy pethen haka yo iolam. Pangayadi, popolen yoyna met ye paday ta ikonin yo ha kamalig ko.’ ” ’  (Mat 13:28b-30)

The disciples did not understand and said to Jesus, “Please explain this story to us.” Jesus said, “The man who planted the good seed is the Messiah. The field is the world. The good seed represents the people of God’s Kingdom.”


“Apo, habiyen mo man kammi no hinyay labay habiyen nin pangilalayi mo tongkol ha iilamon ha panamanan.” 
Nakibat yay Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hiyay nanabwag nin manged a bini', ket homain kanayon no aliwan hikon ibat ha langit a in-Anak nin Tao. Hiyay pananamanan, ket babe lota. Hiyay manged a bini', ket hilay tataon anhakopen nan Apo Dioh. (Mat 13:36b-38a)


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-09.jpg}}


“The weeds represent the people who belong to the evil one. The enemy who planted them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world, and the harvesters are the angels.”


“Ket hilay iilamon, hilay tataon anhakopen nan Satanas. Ket hiyay kaaway a nangihabwag nin lahi iilamon, ket hiyay Satanas met a teed. Hiyay labay habiyen nin pamopol, ket kapopohan nin babe lota. Hilay māmopol, ket hilay pānobolen nin Dioh.” (Mat 13:38b-39)


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-10.jpg}}


“At the end of the world, all the people who belong to the devil will be gathered together and thrown into a fiery furnace, where there is weeping and grinding of teeth. Then the righteous ones will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father.”


No way-omen lan inolot boy inolam ye iilamon, ket wanabay met ateed lano ye malyadi kanlan hakop nan Satanas ha kapopohan nin babe lota. Ket hikon ibat ha langit a in-Anak nin Tao, mangitobol akon malabong a pānobolen ko ta alihen la ha panakop ko ye kaganaan a ampakadyag nin kalok-an a nangibatan nin pagkahalanan nin kanayon. Maitapon hila ha manliyab-liyab a apoy. Ket ihtew hilaynan tomangih boy mangiinaet. Noba hilay tataon matoynong, ket ba-mo hilan tinlag nin mangaamot ihtew ha panakopan nan Bapa la a Dioh. Hikawon ampanlenge, pakaihipen yon manged yati.”  (Mat 13:40-43)

When Jesus returned to heaven, he said that he would return to earth the same way that he left—with a physical body in the clouds. Jesus also promised that when he returns, all Christians who have died will rise from the dead and meet him in the air.


Ha nag-odong yay Apo Jesus ha langit, impangako na a mag-odong ya met ateed lano ihti ha babe lota. Boy hinabi na a ha pag-odong na hilay kaganaan a māmteg a nangamatey, ket bi-ayen na hilan oman omon laya haganaen ha owep.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-12.jpg}}


The Christians who are still alive will then be caught up together with them in the air and all Christians will be with Jesus forever. Jesus will be with his people in perfect unity forever.


Ket hilay māmteg na a angkabi-ay po, ket makilakew hila kanla a makew ha owep, ta pinaykakalamo na hilaynan kaganaan ye māmteg ha matiboen logal. Kalamo la yay Jesus anggan makanoman. Mahayaghag hila boy naymamagha.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-13.jpg}}


Christians will be given the crown of life. They will never experience the second death, which is hell. Instead, they will live forever with God in perfect peace.


Kaganaan a māmteg, ket biyan na hilan bi-ay a homain anggaan. Aglayna dihaen ye ikalwan kamateyan a hiyay impilno. No aliwan, mapagkalamo na hilaynan Apo Dioh anggan makakanoman.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-14.jpg}}


But those who do not believe in Jesus will be judged by God and thrown into hell forever. In hell, people constantly weep and grind their teeth in anguish. They are burned by fire that never goes out and eaten by worms that never die.


Noba hilay ahe namteg kanan Apo Jesus, ket ohgaan na hilan Apo Dioh. Pangayadi, ipalakew na hila ha impilno, ket ihtewbay hilan lanang a tomangih boy manginaet. Ihtewbay hila maolam nin apoy a ahe angkalep boy ololen nin olel a homain kamateyan.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-15.jpg}}


Jesus will also completely destroy Satan and his kingdom and will throw him into the lake of fire where he will burn forever. Death also will be thrown into the lake of fire in hell.


Ket hiyay Apo Jesus, nilood nayaynan dinama ye Satanas boy hilay mānombong na. Boy itapon na hilan kaganaan ha impilno ket ihtewbay hila maolam angga angga. Boy agya hiyay kamateyan, ket maitapon yayna met ha impilno.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-16.jpg}}


Jesus will create a New Heaven and a New Earth. The universe will once again be perfect, as it was before Adam and Eve sinned.


Ket hiyay Apo Jesus, manyag yan bayon langit boy babe lota. Ket kaganaan, mag-ilyadin homain pakaidlawan, a omon ha bayo ya po nagkahalanan ye Adan boy Eva.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-17.jpg}}


And Jesus will reign forever and ever. He will wipe away every tear and there will be no more death, suffering, sadness, crying, evil, or pain. He will rule his Kingdom with peace and justice, and he will be with his people forever.


Ket ihtewbay ya mamoon ye Apo Jesus nin homain anggaan. Ket ponahen na lanoy lowa nin balang magha, homain anan kamateyan, pag-idap, kalelean, tomangih, homain anan kalok-an boy ilab. Mamoon ya ha panakopan na a main katanaan boy katoynongan boy mapagkalamo na hilaynay tatao na anggan makakanoman.
