When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no death or sickness or pain. This was the way God wanted things to be.


Ha hatew, ha pinalhowa nan Apo Dioh ye babe lota, homain bega pangidlawan ha kaganaan a pinalhowa na boy homain po kahalanan. Ket hiyay Adan boy Eba, ampay-ado hila. Wanabay met ateed ye pangado la kanan Apo Dioh. Boy hatew, homain po kamateyan o hakit o ilab, ta wanabay ye labay nan Apo Dioh a malyadi ha kaganaan a pinalhowa na.


BT - In time-past, when Apo God created the earth, there is absolutely nothing to criticize in all which he created and none still sin. And Adan and Eva, they are-loving-each-other. Like-that also is their loving to Apo God. And in time-past, there still is no sin or sickness or pain, for like-that is what Apo God wanted which will-happen to all which he created.

Satan, who was the snake in the garden, deceived Eve, and she and Adam sinned against God. Because they sinned, death, sickness, and pain all became part of life for everyone on earth.


Noba hiyay Satanas, tinalingo na yay Eba. Kaya-bay hiyay Adan boy Eba, nagkahalanan hila. Olin kananyati, nag-ilyadin lamo nin bi-ay nin kaganaan a tatao ha babe lota ye kamateyan, hakit boy ilab.


BT - But Satanas, he deceived Eba. So Adan and Eba, they sinned. Because of this, death, sickness and pain became companion/part of the lives of all people on earth.

Even worse, their relationship with God was broken. Now, everyone is born an enemy of God because of sin. But God had a plan to fix everything that had been broken by sin.


Hiyay maloloke po, hiyay paymamagha nin tao boy Apo Dioh, ket nadama. Paibat ana hatew, kaganaan a nianak, ket kaaway nan Apo Dioh oli ha kahalanan. Agya wanabay man, an-ihipen nan Apo Dioh a pakangeden ye kaganaan a dinama nin kahalanan.


BT - What is more evil still, the uniting-together of people and Apo God, was-destroyed. From back-then, all who were-born, are enemies of Apo God because of sin. Even-though like-that, Apo God is-thinking [of something] that will-make-good all which was-destroyed by sin.

God promised that one of Eve’s descendant would crush Satan’s head, and Satan would wound his heel. This meant that Satan would kill Jesus, but God would raise him to life after three days. Jesus would crush the power of Satan forever.


Impangako nan Apo Dioh kanan Eba hatew, a magha kanlan lalahi na ye mamitpit nin o nan bikat a anhabtan “Satanas”. Noba tokaen na met Satanas ye bitih nan mamitpit nin o na. Hiyay labay habiyen, pateyen na yan Satanas ye Apo Jesus, noba mabi-ay ya met ateed ha ikatlon mangaamot. Ta damaen nan Apo Jesus ye kapalyadiyan nan Satanas.


BT - Apo God promised Eba in time-past, that one of her descendents/clan is the one who will-crush the head of the snake who is-being-called “Satanas”. But Satanas also will-bite-at the feet of the one who will-crush his head. The meaning to say, Satanas will-kill Jesus, but he will-come-to-life anyway on the third day. For Apo Jesus will-destroy the power of Satanas anggan makanoman.

When God destroyed the whole earth in the flood, He provided the boat as a way of salvation for those who believed in Him. In the same way, though everyone deserves to be destroyed for their sins, God has provided a way of salvation for everyone who believes in Jesus.


Ha hatew, ha bayo na damaen Apo Dioh ye babe lota makaoli ha lanab, namadyag ya po kanan Noe nin mayadet a bangka. Yati ye papadan nan Apo Dioh a mangiligtah kanan Noe boy hilay papamilya na oli ha pamteg la kana. Wanabay met a teed ye andyagen nan Apo Dioh kanlan tatao haanin a panaon. Ta agya katapolan yaynan matey ye kaganaan tatao, oli ha kahalanan la, ket nanyag ya po ateed ye Apo Dioh nin papadan a maligtah ye agya hinyaman, makaoli ha pamteg kanan Apo Jesus.


BT - In time-past, when before Apo God will-destroy the earth by-means-of a flood, he still caused- Noe -to-make a large boat. This is the way of Apo God to save Noe and his family because of their faith in-him. Like-that also is what Apo God is-doing to the people at now time. For even-though all people must die because of their sin, Apo God still made a way that even-whoever will-be-saved by-means-of faith/believing in Apo Jesus.

Melchizedek was a priest who blessed Abraham. Like Melchizedek, Jesus is a priest, but Jesus is the Great High Priest. Jesus offered only one sacrifice, himself. This was the only sacrifice needed to take away the sin of the whole world.


Hiyay Melquizedek a maghan padi, in-inged na yay Abraham. Hiyay Apo Jesus, kapadiho na yan Melquizedek a maghan padi. Noba hiyay Apo Jesus ye pinakapoon a padi ket ninghan yan bengat nangihagpa. Hiyay inhagpa na hadili na. Ta hiyabay bengat ye hagpa a makaalih nin kahalanan nin kaganaan a tatao. Kaya-bay hiyay Apo Jesus ye nagdiha nin doha lan kaganaan a tatao, oli ha kakahalanan nin tatao.


BT - Melquizedek who is a priest, he did-good-to/gooded Abraham. Apo Jesus, he is the same as Melquizedek who is a priest. But Apo Jesus is the highest-leader priest and one time only he offered-sacrifice. What he sacrificed is his self. For he only is the sacrifice which can-remove sin of all people. So Apo Jesus is the one who experienced the punishment of all people, because of the sins of people.

God told Abraham, “Through you, all the people groups of the earth will be blessed.” Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the people groups of the earth are blessed through Jesus, because everyone who believes in him becomes one of God’s chosen people, a spiritual descendant of Abraham.


Hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Abraham, a wana, “Makaoli kammo, inged ko hilay kaganaan a tatao ha babe lota.” Hiyay Apo Jesus ket lahi nan Abraham, ket oli kanan Apo Jesus, kaganaan a tataon namteg kana, angkatanggap lay kangedan nan Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay nag-ilyadi hilan tatao nin Dioh, a hiyay espiritwal a lahi nan Abraham.


BT - Apo God spoke to Abraham, he-said, “By-means-of you, I will-do-good to all people on earth.” Apo Jesus is the clan/descent of Abraham, and because of Apo Jesus, all people who believed in him, they are-receiving the goodness of Apo God. So they became the people of God, which are the spiritual clan/descent of Abraham.

God provided a ram for Abraham to sacrifice instead of Isaac. Jesus is like that ram because he died instead of us. Everyone deserves to die for their sins, including you! But God provided Jesus as a sacrifice to die instead of you.


Ha hatew ha inhagpa na yan Abraham ye Isaac, ket pateyen naya dayi. Hiyay Apo Dioh, namyay yan maghan topa a kahagiliyan nan Isaac bilang hagpa. Hiyay Apo Jesus, ba-mon hiyabay yatew a topa. Ta natey ya a kahagiliyan tawo. Hikitawobay dayi ye katapolan a matey oli ha kahalanan tawo! Noba namyay yay Apo Dioh nin hagpa a kahagiliyan tawo, ket hiyabay ye Apo Jesus.


BT - In time-past when Abraham set-down-to-sacrifice Isaac, he will kill him (desire particle). Apo God, he gave a lamb which is the exchange/replacement of Isaac as setting-down/offering. Apo Jesus, it's-like he is that lamb. For he died as our(incl) exchange/replacement. We(incl) (desire particle) are the ones who need to die because of our(incl) sin! But Apo God gave the setting-down/sacrifice which is our(incl) exchange/replacement, and he is Apo Jesus.

When God sent the last plague on Egypt, each Israelite family needed to kill a perfect lamb and spread the blood around their doors. When the angel of God saw the blood, he passed over their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons.


Ha hatew, ha intobol nan Apo Dioh ye hoyot a pamaidap na kanlan Egipcio, hinabi na kanlan Israelita a mangwa hilan maghan lakin oybon topa a pateyen la boy ipolanit lay daya na ha gilid nin ilwangan la. Ket no makit nin panoblen nin Dioh ye daya, ahe na pateyen ye ponganay nin pamilya a angkomonin ihtewbay a baey. Ket yabayti yay anhabtan “Panlomabah nin Panobolen”.


BT - In time-past, when Apo God sent the last causing-to-be-hardship to the Egyptians, he said to the Israelitas that they will-get a male young sheep that they will-kill and they will-spread its blood on the side of their doors. And if the sent-one of God will-see the blood, he will- not -kill the eldest-child of the family which is-residing there in the house. And this is what is-being-called “Passing-by of the Sent-One”.

Jesus is our Passover Lamb. He was perfect and sinless and was killed at the time of the Passover Feast. When anyone believes in Jesus, the blood of Jesus washes away that person’s sin, and God’s punishment passes over him.


Hiyay Apo Jesus ye kalalayian nin topan pinatey la hatew. Homain yan pakaidlawan boy kahalanan. Pinatey ya ha panaon nin pangihipan lan Israelita nin Panlomabah nin Panobolen nin Dioh. Ket haanin, hinyaman a mamteg kana, malinihan ya ha kakahalanan boy ilabah nan Apo Dioh kana ye padohan kakahalanan.


BT - Apo Jesus is the illustration of the sheep/lamp which they killed in time-past. He has nothing to criticize and [no] sin. He was-killed in the time of the remembering of the Israelitas of the Passing-by of the Sent-One of God. And now, whoever will-believe in-him, he will-be-cleansed of his sins and Apo God will-pass-by him the punishment of sins.

God made a covenant with the Israelites who were His chosen people. In God’s New Covenant, anyone from any people group can become part of God’s chosen people by believing in Jesus.


Hiyay Apo Dioh, nanyag yan kahondoan kanlan Israelita, ta hilabay ye tatao a pinili na. Haanin, ha bayon kahondoan, hinyaman a mamteg kanan Apo Jesus, mailamo hilayna kanlan tatao nan Apo Dioh.


BT - Apo God, he made an agreement with the Israelitas, for they are the people he chose. Now, in the new agreement, whoever will-believe in Apo Jesus, they will-companion with the people of Apo God.

Moses was a great prophet who proclaimed the Word of God. Like Moses, Jesus is a prophet, but Jesus is the greatest prophet. He is the Word of God.


Hiyay Moises, magha yan madangal a propetan ampangipatanda nin Habi nin Dioh. Hiyay Apo Jesus, kapadiho na yan propeta ye Moises. Noba hiyay Apo Jesus ye pinakamatagay a propita. Aliwaynan bengat yain, hiyabay po ye Habi nin Dioh.

God promised David that the Messiah would be one of his descendants. Jesus, the Messiah, was that special descendant of David.
