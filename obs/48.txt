When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no death or sickness or pain. This was the way God wanted things to be.

Ha hatew, ha pinalhowa nan Apo Dioh ye babe lota, homain bega pangidlawan ha kaganaan a pinalhowa na  boy homain po kahalanan. Ket hiyay Adan boy Eba, ampay-ado hila. Wanabay met ateed ye pangado la kanan Apo Dioh.  Boy hatew, homain po kamateyan boy hakit, ta  wanabay ye labay nan Apo Dioh a malyadi ha kaganaan  a pinalhowa na.

Satan, who was the snake in the garden, deceived Eve, and she and Adam sinned against God. Because they sinned, death, sickness, and pain all became part of life for everyone on earth.

Noba hiyay Satanas, tinalingo na yay Eba. Kaya-bay hiyay Adan boy Eba, nagkahalanan hila. Olin kananyati, nag-ilyadin lamo nin bi-ay nin kaganaan a tatao ha babe lota ye kamateyan, hakit boy idap.

Even worse, their relationship with God was broken. Now, everyone is born an enemy of God because of sin. But God had a plan to fix everything that had been broken by sin.

Hiyay maloloke po, hiyay paykahondo/paymamagha nin tao boy Apo Dioh, ket nadama. Paibat ana hatew, kaganaan a nianak, ket kaaway nan Apo Dioh, oli ha kahalanan. Agya wanabay man, an-ihipen nan Apo Dioh a pakangeden ye kaganaan a dinama nin kahalanan.

God promised that one of Eve’s descendant would crush Satan’s head, and Satan would wound his heel. This meant that Satan would kill Jesus, but God would raise him to life after three days. Jesus would crush the power of Satan forever.

Impangako nan Apo Dioh kanan Eba hatew, a magha kanlan lalahi na ye mamitpit nin  o nan bikat a anhabtan, <<Satanas.>> Noba tokaen na met Satanas ye bitih nan mamitpit nin o na. Hiyay labay habiyen, pateyen na yan  Satanas ye Jesus, noba mabi-ay ya met ateed ha ikatlon mangaamot.

When God destroyed the whole earth in the flood, He provided the boat as a way of salvation for those who believed in Him. In the same way, though everyone deserves to be destroyed for their sins, God has provided a way of salvation for everyone who believes in Jesus.

Ha hatew, ha bayo na damaen Apo Dioh ye babe lota oli ha lanab, namadyag ya po kanan Noe nin mayadet a bangka. Yati ye papadan nan Apo Dioh a mangiligtah kanan Noe boy hilay papamilya na. Wanabay met a teed ye dinyag nan Apo Dioh kanlan tatao haanin a  panaon. Ta  agya katapolan yaynan matey ye kaganaan tatao, oli ha kahalanan la, ket nanyag ya po ateed ye Apo Dioh nin papadan a maligtah ye agya hinyaman, makaoli ha pamteg kanan Apo Jesus.

Melchizedek was a priest who blessed Abraham. Like Melchizedek, Jesus is a priest, but Jesus is the Great High Priest. Jesus offered only one sacrifice, himself. This was the only sacrifice needed to take away the sin of the whole world.

Hiyay Abraham, in-inged nayan Melquizedek a maghan padi. Hiyay Apo Jesus, kapadiho na yan Melkisedik a maghan padi. Noba hiyay Apo Jesus ye pinakapoon a padi ket ninghan yan bengat nangihagpa, hiyay inhagpa na hadili na. Ta hiyabay  bengat  ye hagpa a makaalih nin kahalanan nin  kaganaan a tatao. Kaya-bay hiyay Apo Jesus ye nagdiha nin doha lan kaganaan a tatao, oli ha  kakahalanan la.

God told Abraham, “Through you, all the people groups of the earth will be blessed.” Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the people groups of the earth are blessed through Jesus, because everyone who believes in him becomes one of God’s chosen people, a spiritual descendant of Abraham.

Hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Abraham, a wana, "Makaoli kammo, inged ko hilay kaganaan a tatao ha babe lota." Hiyay Apo Jesus ket lahi nan Abraham, ket oli kanan Apo Jesus, kaganaan a tataon namteg kana  natanggap lay  kangedan nan Apo Dioh.  Kayabay  nag-ilyadi hilan tatao nin Dioh, espiritwal a lahi nan Abraham.

God provided a ram for Abraham to sacrifice instead of Isaac. Jesus is like that ram because he died instead of us. Everyone deserves to die for their sins, including you! But God provided Jesus as a sacrifice to die instead of you.

Ha hatew ha inhagpa na yan Abraham ye Isaak ket pateyen naya dayi. Hiyay Apo Dioh, namyay yan maghan topa a kahagiliyan nan Isaak bilang hagpa. Hiyay Apo Jesus, ba-mon hiyabay yatew a topa. Ta natey ya a kahagiliyan tawo. Hikitawobay dayi ye katapolan a matey oli ha kahalanan tawo! Noba namyay yay Apo Dioh nin hagpa a kahagiliyan tawo, ket hiyabay ye Apo Jesus.

When God sent the last plague on Egypt, each Israelite family needed to kill a perfect lamb and spread the blood around their doors. When the angel of God saw the blood, he passed over their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons.

Ha hatew, ha intobol nan Apo Dioh ye hoyot a pamahakit na kanlan Egipcio, hinabi na kanlan Israelita  a mangwa hilan maghan lakin oybon topa a pateyen la boy ipolanit lay daya na ha  gilid nin ilwangan la. Ket no makit nin Dioh ye daya, ahe na pateyen ye ponganay nin pamilya a angkomonin ihtewbay a baey. Ket yabayti yay anhabtan "Panlomabah nin Panobolen".

Jesus is our Passover Lamb. He was perfect and sinless and was killed at the time of the Passover Feast. When anyone believes in Jesus, the blood of Jesus washes away that person’s sin, and God’s punishment passes over him.

Hiyay Apo Jesus ye kalalayian nin topan pinatey la hatew. Homain yan pakaidlawan boy kahalanan. Pinatey ya ha panaon nin pangihipan lan Israelita nin Panlomabah nin Panobolen nin Dioh. Ket haanin, hinyaman a mamteg kana, malinihan ya ha kakahalanan boy ilabah nan Apo Dioh kana ye padohan kakahalanan.

God made a covenant with the Israelites who were His chosen people. In God’s New Covenant, anyone from any people group can become part of God’s chosen people by believing in Jesus.

Hiyay Apo Dioh, nanyag yan kahondoan kanlan Israelita, ta hilabay ye tatao a pinili na. Haanin, ha bayon kahondoan, hinyaman a mamteg kanan Apo Jesus, mailamo hilayna kanlan tatao nan Apo Dioh.

Moses was a great prophet who proclaimed the Word of God. Like Moses, Jesus is a prophet, but Jesus is the greatest prophet. He is the Word of God.

Hiyay Moises, magha yan madangal a propetan ampangibalita nin Habi nin Dioh. Hiyay Apo Jesus, kapadiho na yan propeta ye Moises. Noba hiyay Apo Jesus ye pinakamatagay a propita, aliwaynan   bengat yain, hiyabay po ye habi nin Dioh.

God promised David that the Messiah would be one of his descendants. Jesus, the Messiah, was that special descendant of David.

Impangako nan Apo Dioh kanan David a mangibat ya ha lahi na ye lomateng a Mangiligtah. Hiyay andektan nin yatin pangako na, ket hiyay Apo Jesus.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-48-14.jpg}}

Like David, Jesus is a king, but Jesus is the king of the universe! He will come again and rule his Kingdom with justice and peace.

Hiyay David, kapadiho na yan Poon ye Apo Jesus. Noba hiyay Apo Jesus, Poon layan kaganaan a napalhowa.  Ket mag-odong yan oman boy mamoon ya ha panakopan na makaoli ha katoynongany boy  katanaan a homain anggaan.
