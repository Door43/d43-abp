When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no death or sickness or pain. This was the way God wanted things to be.


Ha hatew, ha pinalhowa nan Apo Dioh ye babe lota, homain bega pakaidlawan nin kaganaan a pinalhowa na boy homain po kahalanan. Ket hiyay Adan boy Eba, ampay-ado hila. Wanabay met ateed ye pangado la kanan Apo Dioh. Boy homain po kamateyan hatew o hakit o ilab, ta wanabay ye kalabayan nan Apo Dioh.


BT - In time-past, when Apo God created the earth, there is absolutely nothing to criticize in all which he created and none still sin. And Adan and Eva, they are-loving-each-other. Like-that also is their loving to Apo God. And there still is no death in time-past or sickness or pain, for like-that is the will/desire of Apo God.

Satan, who was the snake in the garden, deceived Eve, and she and Adam sinned against God. Because they sinned, death, sickness, and pain all became part of life for everyone on earth.


Noba hiyay Satanas, tinalingo na yay Eba. Kaya-bay hiyay Adan boy Eba, nagkahalanan hila. Olin kananyati, nag-ilyadin lamo nin bi-ay nin kaganaan a tatao ha babe lota ye kamateyan, hakit boy ilab.


BT - But Satanas, he deceived Eba. So Adan and Eba, they sinned. Because of this, death, sickness and pain became companion/part of the lives of all people on earth.

Even worse, their relationship with God was broken. Now, everyone is born an enemy of God because of sin. But God had a plan to fix everything that had been broken by sin.


Hiyay maloloke po, hiyay paymamagha nin tao boy Apo Dioh, ket nadama. Paibat ana hatew, kaganaan a nianak, ket kaaway nan Apo Dioh oli ha kahalanan. Agya wanabay man, an-ihipen nan Apo Dioh a pakangeden ye kaganaan a dinama nin kahalanan.


BT - What is more evil still, the uniting-together of people and Apo God, was-destroyed. From back-then, all who were-born, are enemies of Apo God because of sin. Even-though like-that, Apo God is-thinking [of something] that will-make-good all which was-destroyed by sin.

God promised that one of Eve’s descendant would crush Satan’s head, and Satan would wound his heel. This meant that Satan would kill Jesus, but God would raise him to life after three days. Jesus would crush the power of Satan forever.


Impangako nan Apo Dioh kanan Eba hatew, a main magha lano kanlan lalahi na a mamitpit nin o nan bikat a anhabtan “Satanas”. Noba tokaen na met Satanas ye bitih nan mamitpit nin o na. Hiyay labay habiyen, pateyen na yan Satanas ye Apo Jesus, noba mabi-ay ya met ateed ha ikatlon mangaamot. Ta damaen nan Apo Jesus ye kapalyadiyan nan Satanas anggan makanoman.


BT - Apo God promised Eba in time-past, that there is one later of her descendents/clan who will-crush the head of the snake who is-being-called “Satanas”. But Satanas also will-bite-at the feet of the one who will-crush his head. The meaning to say, Satanas will-kill Jesus, but he will-come-to-life anyway on the third day. For Apo Jesus will-destroy the power of Satanas forever.

When God destroyed the whole earth in the flood, He provided the boat as a way of salvation for those who believed in Him. In the same way, though everyone deserves to be destroyed for their sins, God has provided a way of salvation for everyone who believes in Jesus.


Ha nalabah nin anoy gatoh a taon paibat kanan Adan boy Eva, dinama nan Apo Dioh ye babe lota makaoli ha lanab oli ha tobat a kalok-an nin tatao. Noba bayo na linanab, namadyag ya po kanan Noe nin mayadet a bangka. Yati ye papadan nan Apo Dioh a mangiligtah kanan Noe boy hilay papamilya na oli ha pamteg la kana. Wanabay met a teed ye andyagen nan Apo Dioh kanlan tatao haanin a panaon. Ta agya katapolan yaynan matey ye kaganaan tatao, oli ha kahalanan la, ket nanyag ya po ateed ye Apo Dioh nin papadan a maligtah ye agya hinyaman, makaoli ha pamteg kanan Apo Jesus.


BT - When hundreds of years had passed from Adan and Eva, Apo God destroyed the earth by-means-of a flood because of the great evil of the people. But before he flooded [it], he still caused- Noe -to-make a large boat. This is the way of Apo God to save Noe and his family because of their faith in-him. Like-that also is what Apo God is-doing to the people at now time. For even-though all people must die because of their sin, Apo God still made a way that even-whoever will-be-saved by-means-of faith/believing in Apo Jesus.

God told Abraham, “Through you, all the people groups of the earth will be blessed.” Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the people groups of the earth are blessed through Jesus, because everyone who believes in him becomes one of God’s chosen people, a spiritual descendant of Abraham.


Ha nalabah nin anoy gatoh a taon paibat ha lanab, hinabi nan Apo Dioh ha maghay laki a nagngalan Abram, wana,  “Makaoli kammo, inged ko hilay kaganaan a tatao ha babe lota.” Hiyay Apo Jesus ket lahi nan Abraham, ket oli kanan Apo Jesus, kaganaan a tataon namteg kana, angkatanggap lay kangedan nan Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay nag-ilyadi hilan tatao nin Dioh, a hiyay espiritwal a lahi nan Abraham.


BT - When hundreds of years had passed from the flood, Apo God spoke to a man named Abram, he-said, “By-means-of you, I will-do-good to all people on earth.” Apo Jesus is the clan/descent of Abraham, and because of Apo Jesus, all people who believed in him, they are-receiving the goodness of Apo God. So they became the people of God, which are the spiritual clan/descent of Abraham.

God provided a ram for Abraham to sacrifice instead of Isaac. Jesus is like that ram because he died instead of us. Everyone deserves to die for their sins, including you! But God provided Jesus as a sacrifice to die instead of you.

Hatew ha panaon nan Abraham, hinabi nan Apo Dioh kana a ihagpa nayay anak na a hiyay Isaac. Noba bayo naya mapatey, namyay yay Apo Dioh kana nin maghan topa a kahagili nan Isaac a hagpa. Hiyay Apo Jesus, ba-mon hiyabay yatew a topa. Ta natey ya a kahagiliyan tawo. Hikitawobay dayi ye katapolan a matey oli ha kahalanan tawo! Noba namyay yay Apo Dioh nin hagpa a kahagiliyan tawo, ket hiyabay ye Apo Jesus.


BT - In-time-past in the time of Abraham, Apo God told him that he will-set-down-to-sacrifice his child who is Isaac. But before he will-kill him, Apo God gave him a lamb which is the exchange/replacement of Isaac as setting-down/offering. Apo Jesus, it's-like he is that lamb. For he died as our(incl) exchange/replacement. We(incl) (desire particle) are the ones who need to die because of our(incl) sin! But Apo God gave the setting-down/sacrifice which is our(incl) exchange/replacement, and he is Apo Jesus.

When God sent the last plague on Egypt, each Israelite family needed to kill a perfect lamb and spread the blood around their doors. When the angel of God saw the blood, he passed over their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons.

Pangalabah nin 400 a taon, hilay lalahi nan Isaac ket nakew hilan kinomonin ha Egipto. Ket ihtew hila inipoh. Hiyay Apo Dioh, nalonoh ya kanla. Olin yati, nangitobol yay Apo Dioh nin pamaidap kanlan Egipsio, omon la hila palobohan ye tatao na a makaalih. Ket ha hoyot a pangitobol na, hinabi na kanlan tatao na a mangwa hilan maghan lakin oybon topa a pateyen la boy ipolanit lay daya na ha gilid nin ilwangan la. Ket no makit nin panoblen nin Dioh ye daya, ahe na pateyen ye ponganay nin pamilya a angkomonin ihtewbay a baey. Ket yabayti yay anhabtan “Panlomabah nin Panobolen”.


BT - After-passed 400 years, the clan/descent of Isaac they went to live/reside in Egipto and there they were-enslaved. Apo God, he had-compassion to-them. Because of this, Apo God sent causing-to-be-harship to the Egipsio that they will-allow the people of Apo God to be able-to-leave. And at the last of his sending, he said to the Israelitas that they will-get a male young sheep that they will-kill and they will-spread its blood on the side of their doors. And if the sent-one of God will-see the blood, he will- not -kill the eldest-child of the family which is-residing there in the house. And this is what is-being-called “Passing-by of the Sent-One”.

Jesus is our Passover Lamb. He was perfect and sinless and was killed at the time of the Passover Feast. When anyone believes in Jesus, the blood of Jesus washes away that person’s sin, and God’s punishment passes over him.


Hiyay topan pinatey la hatew ye kalalayian nan Apo Jesus. Homain yan pakaidlawan boy kahalanan. Napatey ya pangalabah nin anoy gatoh a taon ha panaon nin pangihipan lan Israelita nin Panlomabah nin Pānobolen nin Dioh. Ket haanin, hinyaman a mamteg kanan Apo Jesus, malinihan ya ha kakahalanan boy ilabah nan Apo Dioh kana ye padoha oli ha kahalanan.


BT - Apo Jesus is the illustration of the sheep/lamp which they killed in time-past. He has nothing to criticize and [no] sin. He was-killed in the time of the remembering of the Israelitas of the Passing-by of the Sent-One of God. And now, whoever will-believe in Apo Jesus, he will-be-cleansed of his sins and Apo God will-pass-by him the punishment of sins.

God made a covenant with the Israelites who were His chosen people. In God’s New Covenant, anyone from any people group can become part of God’s chosen people by believing in Jesus.


Hiyay Apo Dioh, nanyag yan kahondoan kanlan Israelita, ta hilabay ye tatao a pinili na. Haanin, ha bayon kahondoan, hinyaman a mamteg kanan Apo Jesus, mag-ilyadi hilan tatao nan Apo Dioh.


BT - Apo God, he made an agreement with the Israelitas, for they are the people he chose. Now, in the new agreement, whoever will-believe in Apo Jesus, they will-become people of Apo God.

Moses was a great prophet who proclaimed the Word of God. Like Moses, Jesus is a prophet, but Jesus is the greatest prophet. He is the Word of God.


Ha inligtah na hilan Apo Dioh ye tatao na ha Egipto, hiyay Moises ye pinili na a mangona kanla. Hiyay Moises, magha yan madangal a propeta. Hiyay Apo Jesus, kapadiho na yan propeta ye Moises. Noba hiyay Apo Jesus ye pinakamatagay a propita. Aliwaynan bengat yain, hiyabay po ye Habi nin Dioh.  


BT - Moises, he is one honored prophet who is-causing-to-know the Word of God. Apo Jesus, he is a prophet the same as Moises. But Apo Jesus is the one who is the highest prophet. Not just that, he still is the Word of God.

God promised David that the Messiah would be one of his descendants. Jesus, the Messiah, was that special descendant of David.

Ha nalabah nin apat a gatoh a taon, hiyay poon lan Israelita ket hiyay David.  Impangako nan Apo Dioh kana a mangibat ya lano ha lahi na ye lomateng a Mangiligtah. Hiyay andektan nin yatin pangako na, ket hiyay Apo Jesus.

Like David, Jesus is a king, but Jesus is the king of the universe! He will come again and rule his Kingdom with justice and peace.


Hiyay David, kapadiho na yan Poon ye Apo Jesus. Noba hiyay Apo Jesus, Poon layan kaganaan a napalhowa. Ket mag-odong yan oman boy mamoon ya ha panakopan na makaoli ha katoynongan boy katanaan a homain anggaan.
