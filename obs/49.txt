Jesus’ mother, Mary, was a virgin when he was born because Jesus is God’s Son. Jesus is both God and man at the same time.

Hiyay Maria ha in-anak nayay Jesus, homain ya po diha, olita Anak yan Dioh ye Jesus. Ket hiyay Apo Jesus, Dioh ya boy tao.

BT - Maria when she gave-birth-to Jesus, she still had no experience (euphemism for sexual activity), because Jesus is the Child of God. And Apo Jesus, he is God and person.

Malabong a kapagtakaan ye didinyag nan Apo Jesus a ampakapapteg a Dioh ya. Hiyay pangomodang na ha babe lanom, hiyay pamatgen na nin makhaw a agoot, pamaitaah na nin malabong a ampaghakit, pamaalih na nin maloke a ihpidito kanlan tatao, pami-ay na nin nanatey boy hiyay pamakan na nin 5,000 katao makaoli ha liliman tinapay bengat boy loway malanghit, ket ampakapapteg a Dioh ya.

Jesus taught that salvation is worth more than anything else in the world.

In-adal na po Apo Jesus a maaalaga ya po ye kaligtahan nin tao ha padoha nin kahalanan, dinan makwa nay kaganaan a kabatnangan ihti ha babe lota.

BT - Apo Jesus also taught that greater still is the salvation of a person from the punishment of sin, than he will-get all the wealth/riches here on earth.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-06.jpg}}

He taught that not all people will receive him and be saved. Those who are not saved will be gathered at the end of the world and will burn forever in the fires of hell.

Impatanda na po a aliwan kaganaan a tatao ket mananggap kana boy maligtah. Ket hilay ahe nananggap kana, ha matey hila o maabot ye kalampohan nin babe lota, maolam hila ha ahe angkalep a apoy ha impilno.

Jesus taught that God loves sinners very much. He is ready to forgive them and make them His children.

Hinabi nan Apo Jesus a ang-adoen na hilan tobat Apo Dioh ye tatao agya po man magkahalanan hila. Ket nakahadya ya a mamatawad kanla boy ibilang na hilan aanak na.

BT - Apo Jesus said that Apo God loves very-much people even still they are sinners. And he is prepared to forgive them and he will-count/consider them as his children.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-08.jpg}}

Jesus also taught that everyone in the world has sinned and is separated from God. Because of sin, everyone has become an enemy of God. God hates sin.

Hiyay Apo Jesus, hinabi na met a nagkahalanan ye kaganaan a tatao ket naihyay hila kanan Apo Dioh. Ket oli ha kahalanan, nag-ilyadin kaaway nan Apo Dioh ye kaganaan a tatao, ta kaholog nin Dioh ye kahalanan.

BT - Apo Jesus, he said also that all people sinned and they have-been-separated from Apo God. And because of sin, all people became enemy of Apo God, for sin is hatred/enemy of God.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-09.jpg}}

But God loved the world so much that He gave His only son, Jesus, so that whoever believes in Him will not go to hell but will live with Him forever.

Noba oli ha tobat a pangado nan Apo Dioh ha kaganaan a tatao ihti ha babe lota,  in-ibyay na yay bogtong a Anak na omon ahe mapadohaan ye agya hinyaman a mamteg kanan  Anak na, no aliwan magkamain hilan bi-ay a homain anggaan.

Because of your sin, you are guilty. You deserve death and God’s anger, but God poured out His anger on Jesus instead. When Jesus died on the cross, he received your punishment.

Ket oli ta magkahalanan ka, hohto bengat kammo ye kamateyan boy poot nan Apo Dioh. Noba hiyay Apo Jesus ye nangibohbohan nan poot na, aliwan hika. Nalyadi yati ha natey yay Apo Jesus ha kodoh. Ket ihtew ha kodoh, hiyabay ye nananggap nin doha mo.

BT - And because you are a sinner, death and anger of Apo God is only what is correct for you. But Apo Jesus is the one whom he poured his wrath on, not you. This happened when Apo Jesus died on the cross. And there on the cross, he is the one who received your punishment.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-11.jpg}}

Jesus chose to die as a perfect, sinless sacrifice to take away your sins and the sins of the whole world. Because of Jesus, any sin can be forgiven, no matter what it is.

Hiyay Apo Jesus ye hagpa a kabayadan nin kahalanan mo. Homain yan kahalanan. Kaya-bay malyadi nan bayadan ye kahalanan mo. Ket oli kanan Apo Jesus, mapatawad anay kaganaan a kakahalanan mo.

BT - Apo Jesus is the sacrifice/setting-down which is the payment of your sin. He has no sin. So he can pay-for your sin. And because of Apo Jesus, all your sins will-be-forgiven.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-12.jpg}}

No one can be saved by doing good things. Nothing you do can fix your relationship with God. Your sins can only be washed away if you believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and that he died and rose again to take away your sins.

Homain makapiligtah nin hadili na makaoli ha panyag nan manganged. Homain kan mababa a mangipakanged nin paymamagha mo kanan Apo Dioh. Mapatawad bengat ye kahalanan mo, no pamtegan mo a hiyay Apo Jesus ye Anak nin Dioh boy natey ya noba nabi-ay yan oman, omon na alihen ye kahalanan mo.

BT - None can-save his self by-means-of doing good. You have no ability to cause-to-be-good your uniting to Apo God. Your sins will-be-forgiven only if you believe that Apo Jesus is the Child of God and he died but came-to-life again in order that he will-remove your sin.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-13.jpg}}

Anyone who believes in Jesus and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be rejected. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you are from. God loves you and wants you to believe in Jesus so He can have a relationship with you.

Hinyaman a mamteg kanan Apo Jesus a bilang Apo na boy mabawtihmowan, ket maligtah ya. Noba hinyaman a ahe mamteg ket maikahwil ya. Aliwan maalaga no mabandi ka o maidap, laki man o babayi, matowa man o anak, o no taga way-ihtew ka man. Ta ang-adoen na kan Apo Dioh boy labay na kan makimamagha kanan Apo Jesus, omen ka mag-ilyadin anak nin Dioh.
