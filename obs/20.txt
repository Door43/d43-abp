Hilay tatao ha Israel, bilang impadoha nan Apo Dioh kanla, nahambot hila kanlan taga Assiria. Ket hilay hohondaloh nin Assira, pinatey lay malabong a Israelita boy inolam lay babanwa ha Israel boy kingwa lan kaganaan a mangaalaga a babandi la.

The people in the kingdom of Judah saw how God had punished the kingdom of Israel for not believing and obeying Him. But they still worshiped idols and the gods of the Canaanites. God sent prophets to warn them, but they refused to listen.

Even though the Exile was punishment for their sin, God did not forget His people or His promises. God watched over His people and spoke to them through His prophets. He promised that, after seventy years, they would return to the Promised Land again.

Shortly after Cyrus came to power, he did something that had never been done before in history. He gave an order that any Jew who wanted to return to Judah could go. He even gave them money to rebuild the Temple! After seventy years in exile, a small group of Jews returned to Jerusalem.


Ha ahe po naboyot ye panakop nan Poon Ciro, impabalita nay bilin, a wana, “Hikawon Jujudio, malyadi kawoynan moli ha Juda, ta ipaideng yon oman ye naagwat a Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh.” Ket hiyay maghay makandin pangkat lan Jujudio, nag-odong hilan peteg ha Jerusalem.
