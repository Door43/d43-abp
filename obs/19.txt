Throughout the history of the Israelites, God sent them prophets. The prophets heard messages from God and then told the people God’s messages.


Paibat po ha onan panaon, ampangitobol yay Apo Dioh nin popropeta na a makew kanlan Israelita. Ta hilabay anay ampangipatanda kanlan tatao nin an-ipahabi nan Apo Dioh.

BT - From still the first time, Apo God is-sending his prophets to go to the Israelites. For they are the ones who are-causing-to-know to the people what is-causing-to-be-said by Apo God.

Elijah was a prophet when Ahab was king over Israel. Ahab was an evil man who encouraged people to worship a false god named Baal. Elijah said to Ahab, “There will be no rain or dew in Israel until I say so.”

Hatew ha panaon a hiyay Ahab ye poon ha Israel, hiyay Elias ye propeta nin Dioh. Hiyay Poon Ahab, in-atay na hilay tataon manggalang kanan Baal a aliwan peteg a dioh. Ket hinabi nan Elias kana, a wana, “Tandah yan mangodan ha kaganaan a lologal nin Israel agya dalaidi bengat anggan ahe ko po habiyen a mangodan oman.” Kaya-bay napoot yan tobat ye Poon Ahab.

BT - In-time-past in the time that Ahab is the ruler of Israel, Elias is the prophet of God. Ruler Ahab, he persuaded the people to honor/worship Baal who is a not true God. And Elias spoke to-him, he-said, "[It] will not rain in all the places of Israel even only sprinkle while I have not yet said that [it] will-rain again." So Ruler Ahab was very angry.

Then God told Elijah to hide in the wilderness near a stream. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. Ahab and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. The drought was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.

Hilay tatao nan Poon Ahab, antapolen la yay Elias. Noba ahe la ya nakitan ta pinatayo na yan Apo Dioh ha maghay logal a main hobol a ampinoman. Ket tepe mahanib, main oowak a ampangilakew kana nin tinapay boy kena. Noba oli ta ahe yayna ampangodan, ket namal-an yaynay hobol a ampinoman na.

BT - The people of Ruler Ahab, they are-looking-for Elias. But they did not find him for Apo God caused- him -to-hide in a place which has a spring which [he] is-drinking-from. And each morning, there are crows which are-bringing to-him bread and meat. But because it is- not -raining, became-dry already the spring he is-drinking-from.

So Elijah went to a neighboring country. A widow and her son had almost run out of food because of the famine. But they took care of Elijah, and God provided so that neither their flour jar nor their bottle of oil ever ran out. They had food through the whole famine. Elijah stayed there a long time.

Kaya-bay hiyay Apo Dioh, pinalakew na yay Elias ha maghan nahyon a maahaley ha Israel. Main met bawon babayi ihtewbay a main maghay anak a laki. Ket madanon anan maoboh ye pamangan la, oli ta naboyot anan homain odan. Noba agya wanabay man, pinaona laya po a pinakan ye Elias. Ket hiyay nalyadi, agya naboyot yay Elias ihtewbay, ahe la angkaobohoboh ye kanen la, ta hiyay Apo Dioh ye ampamalwah nin pamamangan la.

BT - So Apo God, he caused-to-go Elias to a nation which is close to Israel. There also is a widow woman there who has a male child. And soon now will-be-empty/consumed their food, because long-time now there is no rain. But even-though like-that, they still caused-to-go-first to eat Elias. And what happened, even-though Elias was long-time there, they are- not -consuming-all their food (lit. to-be-eaten), for Apo God is the one who is-causing-to-come-out their food.

After three years, God told Elijah to return to Israel and speak with Ahab because He was going to send rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There you are, you troublemaker!” Elijah said, “You are the troublemaker! You have abandoned the true God and worshiped Baal. Bring all of Israel to Mount Carmel.”

Pangalabah nin tatlon taon boy kagitna, hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Elias, a wana, “Mag-odong kayna ha Israel, ta habiyen mo kanan Poon Ahab a paodanen ko yayna.” 
Noba ha nakit na yay Elias, hinabi na met kanan Elias, a wana, “Ah! Anti kan bengat manayti ihen a mapanggolo ha Israel!” 
Nakibat yay Elias, a wana, “Hikay mapanggolo ha Israel! Ta naliwaan moy peteg a Dioh. Ket haanin, ampanggalang kayna kanan Baal a aliwan peteg a dioh. Haanin, ilakew mo hilay tatao a makew ha Mapantay nan Carmelo.”

BT - After three years and a half, Apo God spoke to Elias, he-said, “(You) return to Israel, for (you) tell Ruler Ahab that I will-cause-to-rain now.”
But when he saw Elias, he spoke to Elias, he-said, “Ah! You are just present (surprise particle) there who is the trouble-maker in Israel!”
Elias answered, he-said, “You are the trouble-maker in Israel! For you forgot the true God. And now, you are-honoring/worshipping Baal who is the not true god. Now, (you) bring people to go to the Mountain of Carmelo.”

All the people of the kingdom of Israel, including the 450 prophets of Baal, came to Mount Carmel. Elijah said to the people, “How long will you keep changing your mind? If Yahweh is God, serve him! If Baal is God, serve him!”

Kaya-bay nakew yay Poon Ahab boy hilay tatao ihtew ha Mapantay nan Carmelo, lamo la hilay 450 a popodopeta nan Baal. Ket hinabi nan Elias kanlan kaganaan, a wana, “Paholong nayi a paoman oman ye ihip yo tongkol kanan Apo Dioh? No hiyay Apo Dioh ye peteg a Dioh, paghilbiyan yo ya. Noba no hiyay Baal ye peteg a Dioh, ket hiyabay anan bengat ye paghilbiyan yo!”

BT - Therefore Ruler Ahab and the people went there to the Mountain of Carmelo, companioned with the 450 prophets of Baal. And Elias spoke to all of them, he-said, “Will-continue (rhetorical question marker) that change-over-and-over is your(PL) thinking about Apo God? If Apo God is the true God, (you-PL) serve him. But if Baal is the true God, he now only is the one you(PL) will-serve!”

Then he said to the prophets of Baal, “Kill a bull and prepare a sacrifice, but do not light the fire. I will do the same. The God who answers with fire is the real God.” So the priests of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.

Pangayadi, hinabi nan podopetan Elias kanlan popodopeta nan Baal, a wana, “Mangwa kawon baka boy patyen. Ket hiyay hinapo a kena ye ihagpa yo. Noba adi yo paetan nin apoy a pangolam. Ta no peteg a hiyay Baal ye Dioh, hiyabay tana ye mangolam.  Agya hiko met, wanabay met ateed ye dapaten ko papainghan.” Ket dinapat lan peteg nin podopeta nan Baal ye hinabi nan podopetan Elias.

BT - Afterwards, the prophet Elias spoke to the prophets of Baal, he-said, “(You-PL) get a cow and kill [it]. And the cut-up meat is what you(PL) will-offer. But don't you light with fire to burn. For if true that Baal is God, he then only is the one to-burn. Even I also, like-that also is what I will-do later(today).” And the prophets of Baal truly did what the prophet Elias said.

Then they prayed to Baal, “Hear us, O Baal!” All day long they prayed and shouted and even cut themselves with knives, but Baal did not answer.

Ket nakigwang hila, a wanla, “Dioh min Baal, leng-en mo kayi.” Nikahilem hilan ampakigwang a ampangha boy anhogat-hogaten lay loti la noba homain yan pakibat ye Baal.

BT - And they prayed, they-said, "God of ours(excl) Baal, (you) listen-to us(excl)." All-afternoon they are-praying shouting and they are-wounding still their skin but Baal has no answer.

At the end of the day, Elijah prepared a sacrifice to God. Then he had twelve huge pots of water poured on top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around the altar was completely wet.

Ket ha mahilem ana, hiyay Elias, hiyabay ana met ye nangihagpa nin hinapo a baka kanan Apo Dioh a anggalangen na. Ket hiyay dinapat na, pinabohbohan na po nin lanom a labinlowan halaw ye hagpa na. Ket naheb anan lanom ye pandongot boy palibot nin hagpa.

BT - And when afternoon now, Elias, he also offered (lit. set-down) cut-up cow to Apo God whom he is-honoring. And what he did, he caused-to-be-poured-on still twelve jars of water on his offering. And was-filled now with water is the firewood and surrounding of the offering.

Then Elijah prayed, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that You are the God of Israel and that I am Your servant. Answer me so that these people will know that You are God.”

Pangayadi nan impabohbohan, ket nakigwang ya, a wana, “Apo a Dioh nan Abraham, Isaac boy Hacob, ipakit mo haanin a hika ye peteg a Dioh nin Israel boy hikon ampaghilbi kammo. Ket leng-en mo Apo ye pamakigwang ko kamo ta omen la matandaan nin tatao a hika ye peteg a Dioh.”

BT - After he caused-to-be-poured-on, he prayed, he-said, “Apo God of Abraham, Isaac, and Hacob, (you) show now that you are the true God of Israel and I am the one serving you. And (you) listen Apo to my praying to-you in order that the people will-know that you are the true God.”

Immediately, fire fell from the sky and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, and even the wet ground around the altar. When the people saw this, they fell on the ground and said, “The LORD is God! The LORD is God!”

Kapipikhaan, nangiampag yay Apo Dioh nin apoy a ibat ha langit a pangolam nan peteg nin baka, kayo boy dadapah angga ha kinomlang ye lota ha palibot nin pangihagpaan. Ket ha nakit lan tatao yatin nalyadi, nanlimokod hila boy hinabi la, a wanla, “Hika Apo Dioh ye peteg a Dioh! Hika Apo Dioh ye peteg a Dioh!”

BT - Suddenly, Apo God made-fall fire from heaven which truly burned-up the cow, wood and rocks until dried-up the ground around the altar (lit. setting-down-place). And when the people saw this which happened, they kneeled-down and they spoke, they-said, "You are Apo God who is the true God! You are Apo God who is the true God!"

Then Elijah said, “Do not let any of the prophets of Baal escape!” So the people captured the prophets of Baal. Then Elijah took them away and killed them.

Ket hinabi nan Elias kanlan tatao, a wana, “Dakepen yo hila! Adi yo hila ampaolayen a makatakah ye poporopeta nan Baal!” Kaya-bay, dinakep na hila boy pinatey.

BT - And Elias spoke to the people, he-said, “(You-PL) capture them! Don't you(PL) disregard/pay-no-attention that the prophets of Baal will-be-able-to-escape!” Therefore, they captured them and killed [them].

Then Elijah said to King Ahab, “Return immediately to the city, for the rain is coming.” Soon the sky grew black, and a large rain storm came. God had ended the drought and proved that He is the only God.

Ket hinabi na met nin Elias kanan Poon Ahab, a wana, “Tampol kaynan mag-odong ha mayadet a banwa ta madanon anay malgeh a odan.” Ahe nagboyot, nangodan yaynan peteg nin malgeh boy makhaw ye agoot. Kaya-bay oli ha apoy a ibat ha langit boy ha makhaw a odan, ket natandaan laynay Dioh a kaptegan.

BT - And Elias also spoke to Ruler Ahab, he-said, "Quickly (you) return now to the large city for soon now is the heavy rain.” Not long-time, it rained truly strongly and strong is the wind/typhoon/cyclone. Therefore because of the fire from heaven and the strong rain, they knew already the true God.

After Elijah, God chose Elisha to be His prophet. God did many miracles through Elisha. One time, Naaman, an enemy commander, found out he had a horrible skin disease called leprosy. He had heard of Elisha so he went and asked Elisha to be healed. Elisha told him to dip himself seven times in the Jordan River.

Hiyay Elias, ahe ya natey ta kapipikhaan, anti yaynan tampol ha langit. Pangayadi, hiyay propita Eliseo met ye kahagiliyan na. Boy malabong met ateed ye dinyag nan Apo Dioh a kapagtakaan makaoli kanan Eliseo. Hiyay maghan kapagtakaan a dinyag nan Apo Dioh, ket hiyay pamaitaah nan Eliseo kanan Naaman a kapitan nin hohondalon kalaban lan Israelita. Main yan hakit ha loti ye Naaman a ampakailoy. Ket nabalitaan nay tongkol kanan Eliseo. Kaya-bay pinakihabi na kanan Eliseo, a wana, “No malyadi dayi, paitaahen mo ko.” Ket haanin, intobol na yan Eliseo ye Naaman a makew ha Kabatowan nin Jordan a donglep nin mikapiton okdo.

BT - Elias, he did not die for suddenly, he is quickly in heaven. Afterwards, the prophet Eliseo then is his replacement. And many also were the things Apo God did which are amazing-thing by-means-of Eliseo. One of the amazing-things which Apo God did, is the healing by Eliseo to Naaman who is captain of the soldiers of the enemies of Israel. Naaman has a very disgusting/ugly sickness on the skin. And he heard-news about Eliseo. Therefore he cause-to-speak to Eliseo, he-said, "If possible (desire particle), (you) heal me." And now, Eliseo sent Naaman to go dip-down seven times in the River Jordan.

At first Naaman was angry and would not do it. But later he changed his mind and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan River. When he came up the last time, his skin was completely healed! God had healed him.

Ha pamakange nan Naaman ye hinabi nan Eliseo, napoot ya boy ahe na labay ye makew. Noba nakew ya met ateed a dinonglep nin nikapiton okdo. Ket ha ikapiton pandomlep nan Naaman boy ha kinomondolaw ya, ket nakit na a homain yaynan hakit ha loti, ta pinaitaah na yaynan Apo Dioh.

BT - When Naaman heard what Eliseo said, he was-angry and he did not want to go. But he went anyway dipped-down seven times. And on the seventh dipping-down of Naaman and when he came-up, he saw that he has no more sickness on skin, for Apo God healed him.

There were many other prophets. They all told the people to stop worshiping idols and to start showing justice and mercy. The prophets warned the people that if they did not turn from their sins and start living obedient lives, then God’s judgment would come, and He would punish them.


Hilay popropeta, lanang lan an-ipatanda kanlan tatao, a wanla, “Maghehe kawoyna ha kakahalanan yo boy itgen yoynay panggalang yon aliwan peteg a dioh. Ta no ahe kawo magbi-ay nin matoynong boy ahe manopad ha bibilin nin Apo Dioh, homain hapon padohaan na kawo.”

BT - The prophets, always they are-causing-to-know to the people, they-say, “(You-PL) repent now of your(PL) sins and (you-PL) stop honoring your(PL) not true gods. For if you(PL) do not live righteously and fulfill the commands of Apo God, certain that he will-punish you(PL).”

Most of the time, the people did not listen. They often mistreated the prophets and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet Jeremiah was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and pulled him out before he died.


Noba adi lan teed an-ibabano ye bibilin a an-ipatanda lan popodopeta na. No minghan, ampateyen la hila. Ket hilay kanayon met, ampahakitan la hila a omon kanan propeta Jeremias. Ta ingkolbot la ya ha maale a libon a homain lanom boy linakwanan la ya ta omon ya matey ihtewbay. Noba kinolohan yan Poon. Kaya-bay nilakew na yan kingwa ta omen ya ahe matey.

BT - But, they still are- not -acknowledging recognizing the commands which the prophets are-causing-to-know. Sometimes, they are-killing them. And others they are-mistreating/causing-pain-to like to prophet Jeremias. For they dropped him in a deep well with no water and they abandoned/left-alone in order that he will-die there. But the ruler had-mercy-on him. So he went to get him in order that he will- not -die.

Even though the prophets were hated, they continued to speak for God. They warned people that they would be destroyed if they did not repent. They also reminded people of the promise that God’s Messiah would come.


Hilay popropeta, agya angkapatiyatiyan hila, ket imbabala la po ateed ye impatanda nan Apo Dioh kanla, a wanla, “No ahe kawoyna maghehe ha kakahalanan yo, madama kawo.” Ket hiyay impaihip la met nin kanayon a propita, “Yo! Ihipen yoy impangako nan Apo Dioh a itobol na yay Mesias a Mangiligtah kantawo.”

BT - The prophets, even-though they are-being-oppressed/treated-badly, they exhorted anyway what Apo God caused-to-know to-them, they-said, “If you(PL) do not now repent of your(PL) sins, you(PL) will-be-destroyed." And what other prophets caused-to-think also, "Yo! (You-PL) think-about what Apo God promised that he will-send a Mesias Savior to-us(incl).”
