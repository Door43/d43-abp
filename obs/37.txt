One day, Jesus received a message that Lazarus was very sick. Lazarus and his two sisters, Mary and Martha, were good friends of Jesus. When Jesus heard this news, he said, “This sickness will not end in death, but it will bring glory to God.” Jesus loved his friends, so he waited where he was for two days.

Kaya-bay, hilay kakatongno na, nangitobol hilan mangihabi kanan Apo Jesus nin wanae, “Apo, hiyay ang-adoen mon gayyem ket mabyat ye hakit na.” 
Ha nange nan Apo Jesus yatew, hinabi na a wana, “Ahe nan ikamatey nin Lazaro ye hakit na. Nagkahakit ya omon ya maidangal ye Dioh boy makaoli ha pamakapitaah na, maidangal ya met ye Anak nin Dioh.” 
Noba agya ang-adoen na hilan Apo Jesus ye mikakatongnon Marta, Maria, boy Lazaro, ket kinomonin ya po nin loway mangaamot ha logal a angkonaan na.  (John 11:3-6)

Then he said to his disciples, “Let’s go back to Judea.” “But Teacher,” the disciples answered, “Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!” Jesus said, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.”

Pangayadi, hinabi nan Apo Jesus kanlan manombong na, a wana, “Mag-odong kitawoyna ha plobinhiyan Judea.” 

Noba hinabi la met kana, a wanla, “Maihtodo, hilay Jujudio ihtew, nakanon bengat a labay la kan taponen nin dapah. Taket, ta mag-odong ka po?”  (John 11:7-8)

His disciples replied, “Lord, if Lazarus is sleeping, he will get better on his own.” Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. I am glad we were not there when he died, for now you will see amazing things so that you may believe.”

Pangayadi, hinabi na po Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hiyay Lazaro a gayyem tawo, angkatoloy ya, noba haanin, lakwen ko yan pokawen.” 

Hinabi lan manombong na, a wanla, “Apo, no angkatoloy yan bengat, omnged ya lano!” Ta nabaan la a angkatoloy yan bengat ye Lazaro, noba hiyay labay nan habiyen Apo Jesus, ket natey yayna. Kaya-bay impatonong nan Apo Jesus kanla, a wana, “Hiyay Lazaro ket natey yayna. Noba oli ha ikanged yo, inkaaliket kon ahe ako ihtew, ta makaoli ha dyagen ko, lalalo kawoynan mamteg kangko. Higi, tawoyna kana.”  (John 11:11-15)

When Jesus got there, Lazarus had already been dead for four days. Martha went out to meet Jesus and said, “Master, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I believe God will give you whatever you ask from Him.”

Ha linomateng yaynay Apo Jesus ha banwan Betania, natandaan na a hiyay Lazaro, kinapatan yaynan nailbeng ha yokib.

Ha nabalitaan nan Marta a anlomateng yay Apo Jesus, hinagana na ya. Noba hiyay Maria, nagbantak ya ha baey la. Haanin, hinabi nan Marta kanan Apo Jesus, a wana, “Apo, hiyay katongno ko, ahe ya dayi natey no anti ka ihti. Noba tanda ko, a agya haanin, ibyay na kammon Apo Dioh ye agya hinyaman a awoken mo kana.”  (John 11:17,20-22)

Jesus replied, “I am the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies. Everyone who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” “Yes, Master!” Martha answered. “I believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”

Nakibat ya Apo Jesus kana, a wana, “Hiko ye bi-ay boy pagkabi-ay oman. Hinyaman a ampamteg kangko, agya po matey ya, ket mabi-ay yan oman. Boy hinyaman angkabi-ay a ampamteg kangko, ahe yayna matey. Ampamtegan mo nayi ye hinabi ko?” 

Nakibat yay Marta, a wana, “Awo, Apo. Ampamtegan ko a hika ye Cristo a Anak nin Dioh, a an-agaden min lomateng ihti ha babe lota.”  (John 11:25-27)

Then Mary arrived. She fell at the feet of Jesus and said, “Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.” “Where have you put Lazarus?” he asked them. They told him, “In the tomb. Come and see.” Then Jesus wept.

Ha niabot yay Maria kanan Apo Jesus, nanalimokod ya ha aphayan na boy hinabi na, a wana, “Apo, no anti kan bengat dayi ihti, ket ahe ya dayin natey ye katongno ko.” 

Ha nakit nan Apo Jesus a antomangih yay Maria boy hilay Jujudio a hinomombong kana, ket napoota ya boy nayoot ye ihip na. Haanin nanepet yay Apo Jesus kanla, a wana, “Way-ihtew yo ya in-ilbeng?” 

Nakibat hila kana a wanla, “Apo, makilakew ka kammi omon mo ya makit.” 

Ket tinomangih yay Apo Jesus.  (John 11:32-35)

The tomb was a cave with a stone rolled across its entrance. When Jesus arrived at the tomb, he told them, “Roll the stone away.” But Martha said, “He has been dead for four days. There will be a bad smell.”

Hiyay nangilbengan kanan Lazaro, ket yokib a naleneban nin dapah. Ket ha linomateng yaynay Apo Jesus ihtew, napoot yayna man. Hinabi na, a wana, “Alihen yoy nakaleneb a dapah!” 

Noba hinabi nan Marta a katongno nan natey wana, “Mabata yayna Apo, ta kinapatan yayna.”  (John 11:38-39)


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-37-08.jpg}}

Jesus responded, “Did I not tell you that you would see God’s glory if you believe?” So they rolled the stone away.

Hinabi nan Apo Jesus kana, a wana, “Aliwa nayi hinabi koyna kammo a no mamteg ka, makit moy kapalyadiyan nin Dioh?” 

Kaya-bay, inalih lay dapah a naileneb.  (John 11:40-41)

Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, “Father, thank You for hearing me. I know You always listen to me, but I say this for the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will believe You sent me.” Then Jesus shouted, “Lazarus, come out!”

Tinomangal yay Apo Jesus, ket hinabi na, a wana, “Bapa ko, ampahalamat ako kammo ta anleng-en moko.

Tanda ko a lanang mokon anleng-en, noba hinabi ko yati kammo, ta ikanged lan tataon ampideng ihti, omon hila mamteg a intobol moko.” 

Pangahabi na yatew, nangha ya, a wana, “Lazaro, lomwah kayna.” (John 11:41b-43)

And Lazarus did! He was still wrapped up in grave clothes. Jesus told them, “Help him get out of those grave clothes and release him!” Many of the Jews believed in Jesus because of this miracle.

Ket hiyay Lazaro, linomwah yayna a nabelbelan nin tapih a pangilbeng ye gagamet na boy bibitih na, boy natogpawan nin balotan ye lopa na. Hinabi nan Apo Jesus, a wana, “Alihen yoynay tapih a nakabelbel kana, omon ya makakodang.”


Haanin, ha nakit lan Jujudion kalamo nan Maria ye dinyag nan Apo Jesus, malabong kanla ye namteg kana.  (John 11:44-45)

But the religious leaders of the Jews were jealous, so they gathered together to plan how they could kill Jesus and Lazarus.

Noba hilay kanayon kanla, nakew hila kanlan Papariseo, ta imbalita lay dinyag nan Apo Jesus. Kaya-bay paibat kananyatew a panaon, hilay popoon lan Jujudio, inihip la yaynan pateyen ye Apo Jesus ta omon la ahe damaen nin Roromano ye nahyon la.  (John 11:46,53)
