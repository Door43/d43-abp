One day Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” Jesus said, “Not seven times, but seventy times seven!” By this, Jesus meant that we should always forgive. Jesus told this story.

Haanin, hinomaley yay Pedro kanan Apo Jesus ta nanepet ya, a wana, “Apo, mikano ko ya nayi patawaden ye katongno kon maheheg a ampagkahalanan kangko? Mikapito nayi a okdo?” 
Nakibat yay Apo Jesus kanan Pedro, a wana, “Aliwan bengat mikapito, no aliwan mikapitompo boy piton okdo. (Matt 18:21-22)

“The Kingdom of God is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. One of his servants owed a huge debt worth 200,000 years’ wages.”

Ta hiyay panakop nan Apo Dioh, ket mailalayi ya ha panakop nin maghay poon a namadakit kanlan iipoh na ta hingilen na hilayna ha ootang la. Ha ikana nayna ye maningil, in-adap la yayna kana ye maghay ipoh a nakaotang nin milyon-milyon kana.   (Matt 18:23-24)

“Since the servant could not repay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as slaves to make payment on his debt.’”

Oli ta ahe ya makabayad, hinabi nan poon a, ‘Ilako yo hilaynay mitapamilya a maipoh boy kaganaan a babandi la omon ya makabayad ha inotang na.’ ”  (Matt 18:25)

“The servant fell on his knees before the king and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay everything back.’ The king felt pity for the servant and canceled all of his debt.”

“Ket hiyay ipoh, nanalimokod yan ampakiiingalo kanan poon, a wana, ‘Apo, pangiingalo mo. Mangagad ka po dayi nin makandin panaon omon ako makabayad ha kaganaan a otang ko.’ Haanin, hiyay poon, ket kinalonohan na ya. Kaya-bay ahe nayna pinabayadan ye otang na, ket pinaoli na yayna.”  (Matt 18:26-27)

“The servant went out and found another servant who owed him a debt worth four months’ wages. The servant choked the man and said, ‘Pay me what you owe me!’”

“Noba ha ampoli yaynay ipoh, nahagana na ya met ye maghay ipoh a nakaotang kana nin makandin alaga. Ket hiyay dinyag na kana, dinakep na yan binikke boy hinabi na kana, a wana, ‘Bayadan moynay otang mo kangko!’ ”  (Matt 18:28)

“The man fell on his knees and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay everything back.’ But the servant refused and threw the man in prison until he could pay the debt.”

“Haanin, nanalimokod yan nakiiingalo kana ye kapadiho nan ipoh, a wana, ‘Pangingalo mo. Mangagad ka po dayi nin makandin panaon omon ako makabayad ha kaganaan a otang ko kammo.’ Noba ahe naya kinalonohan, no aliwan impapidiho naya anggan ahe ya makabayad ha inotang na.”  (Matt 18:29-30)

“Some other servants saw what had happened and were greatly disturbed. They went to the king and told him everything.”

“The king called the servant and said, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave your debt because you begged me. You should have done the same.’ In his anger the king threw the wicked servant into prison until he paid back all of his debt.”

“Haanin, hiyay poon, impadakit na yay ipoh ket hinabi na, a wana, ‘Maloke kan tobat a ipoh! Ahe ko impabayadan kammo ye otang mo kangko oli ta nakiingalo ka kangko. Taket ta ahe mo ya kinalonohan ye kapadiho mon ipoh a omon ha panlonoh ko kammo?’ Oli ha tobat a poot nan poon, ket impapidiho naya angga ha mabayadan nay kaganaan a otang na.”  (Matt 18:32-34)

Then Jesus said, “This is what my heavenly Father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”

Haanin, hinabi nan Apo Jesus, a wana, “No ahe kawon loboh a mamatawad nin kapadiho yo, wanabay met ateed ye dyagen na kanyon Bapa kon Dioh ha langit.” (Matt 18:35)
