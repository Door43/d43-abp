More than 400 years after the last prophet spoke to the Jews, an angel appeared to an old priest named Zechariah. He was a godly man, but his wife, Elizabeth, could not have any children.


Ha onan panaon, hiyay Apo Dioh ampaghabi ya kanlan tatao makaoli kanlan aanghel boy popodopita. Noba paibat ha hoyot a paghabina kanla, ahe yayna naghabi kanla ha loob nin 400 gatoh a taon.

The angel said to Zechariah, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him John. He will be the great prophet that comes before the Messiah!” Zechariah responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this will happen?”


Hinabi nin anghel kanan Zacharias, "Hiyay ahawa mo ket manganak yan laki. Pangalanan yo ya lanon Juan. Maheb ya lanon Ihpiditon Dioh ket biyan nayan nakidoman kadonongan. Italadan na hila lanoy tatao ha panlomateng nin Messiah!" Nakibat yay Zacharias a wana, "Matoa kayinan tobat kanan ahawa, way-omen yan malyadi?

The angel answered, “I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left. Zechariah returned home, and his wife became pregnant.


Hinabi nin anghel kanan Zacharias, "Intobol na kon Apo Dioh kammo a mangihabi nin manged a balita. Noba olita ahe mo pinamtegan ye hinabi ko, maomel ka angga lano ha maianak ye ongi." Kapipikhaan, omel yaynay Zacharias boy linakwanan na yaynan anghel ket noli yayna met ye Zacharias. Ha ahe naboyot, naboktot yaynay ahawa na.

When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel appeared to Elizabeth’s relative, whose name was Mary. She was a virgin and was engaged to a man named Joseph. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son.”


Ha anem anay bowan ye boktot nan Elizabeth, yatew a angel, napakit ya met kanan Maria. Hiyay Maria ket balatang ya boy nakataning anan magpakahal kanan Jose. Haanin, hinabi nin anghel kanan Maria, "Bomoktot ka ket manganak kan laki, pangalanan mo ya lanon Jesus. Mahabtan ya lanon Anak nin Katatagayan a Dioh ket mamoon yan makakanoman."

The angel continued, “You are to name him Jesus. He will be the Messiah!” Mary replied, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel explained, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and you will conceive. So your son will be called the Son of the Most High God.”


Nakibat yay Maria, "Way-omen yan malyadi ket balatang ako?" Impalinaw nin anghel kana a wana, "Bomoktot ka makaoli ha kapalyadiyan nin Ihpiditon Dioh, kayabay maianak yan Nahantowan ye ongi boy Anak yan Dioh." Pinamtegan boy inawo nan Maria ye hinabi nin anghel.

Not long after this, Mary went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s baby jumped inside her. The women rejoiced together about what God had done for them. After visiting for three months, Mary returned home.


Pangalabah nin anoy mangaamot, kinewahan nayan Maria ye Elizabeth. Pamakange nan Elizabeth nin pangomohta nan Maria, naggalaw ye ongi ha loob nin bitoka na. Angkaaliket yay Elizabeth boy Maria oli ha dinyag nan Apo Dioh kanla. Kinomonin ya po nin tatloy bowan ye Maria ha baey nan Elizabeth, pangayadi noli yayna.

After Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy, they named him John as the angel commanded. Then God allowed Zechariah to speak again. He said, “Praise God, because He has remembered His people! You, my son, will be called the prophet of the Most High God! You will prepare the way for the Messiah!”


Pangayadi nin pangianak nan Elizabeth, pinangalanan nayan Juan ye ongi na, a omen ha hinabi nin anghel kanla. Ket pinalobohan nayay na met Apo Dioh a makapaghabi ye Zacharias. Hinabi nan Zacharias, "Galangen yay Apo Dioh, ta ahe na liniwaan ye tatao na! Hika anak ko, ket mahabtan ka lanon podopita nin Katatagayan a Dioh. Ipatanda mo lano kanlan tatao no way-omen nayan Apo Dioh patawaden ye kakahalanan la.
